Bente´s hand in fore the first period.

This file is meant to give you an overwiev of this hand in.

I have called the javascript files the same thing as the questions we have to descripe, so it should be easier to find
the logic in. Therefore:

Use strict is called:
- useStrict.js

Hoisting is devided into one with variables and one with functions called:
- hoistingVariable.js
- hoistingFunction.js

This is called:
- this.js

Function closures and the JavaScript Module Pattern are divide into to called:
- closuresAndModule1.js
- closuresAndModule2.js

Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) is called:
-ImmediatelyInvokedFunctionExpressions.js

Javascript Prototyping is devided into two called:
prototyping.js
prototypingArray.js

Debugger is called:
-debugger.js

Callback Functions are divided into three called:
-callbackFunctions1.js
-callbackFunctions2.js
-callbackFunctions3.js

Explain generally about node.js and NPM:
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

Reusable Modules are called:
-reusableModules.js
-reusableModulesPart2.js
and is one assignment, where you run part 2 to see that part one is working.
This assingment was orriginally from learnyounode ex. 6, and wan´t runn in here because the
construction to test the code lies in learnyounode and not here.

I hope this make sence, happy reading.
